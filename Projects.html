<h1>My Projects!</h1>
<p>I've worked on a lot of projects over the last few years of my life, this is the page where all of my contributions to proiects are held.
<br>
<h2>Fallout: New California Developer</h2>
<p>I joined the Fallout: New California team in June of 2019, after helping users out and doing what I could to lighten the load of the developer team, they eventually promoted me to an official staff member so I could help thhem more. As time went on, I eventually rose through the ranks before becoming one of the head developers. I have contributed fixes, quests and other random additions. I am also the head writer/editor for the Fallout: New California wiki, the database of knowledge for the giant, DLC sized mod for Fallout: New Vegas.
<br>
<h2>The 48 Hours Furious Filmmaking Competition</h2>
<p>I have taken part in the 48 Hour Film Competition as part of a student team in 2018 and 2019. Our team consisted of a range of people with different abilities, but I was always leading the team as Director. We did not manage to hand in a successful film either year. We were disqualified in both years for different reasons. Before I took part in the competition as a student, I helped my dad make a few films when he was participating and before that I helped him when he ran the Hamilton/Waikato area of the competition.
