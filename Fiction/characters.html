                <p><B>Where did he come from?</b> <br>
                Leo was born in a facility, dubbed #47, he didn't have much of a life, but was always rewarded. He was biologically engineered to be more human than leopard but lacked some certain life skills, like using the bathroom. He's always been a fan of his food and it was used as a way to get him to obey, making him the size he is now. He has since been released from the facility but he doens't think he'll learn to use the bathroom any time soon and those Heart Stopper burgers just taste so good.</p>
