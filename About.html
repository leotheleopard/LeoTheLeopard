<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my About Page! Here is all the important things people need to know about who I am!</p>
<p class="About">
I am an 18 year old who lives in Auckland, New Zealand. I spent the first 16 years of my life in Hamilton and have only gone overseas once, when I went to Australia with my family. I love technology and computers, I have been attempting to do web design for many many years but only really got into it after High School when I had some free time. I love video games and playing them, but Fallout and Minecraft are my favourites because of the huge amounts of mods for them and the replayability. I run my own Minecraft server from home that was set up with the help of a friend. I am not a huge fan of TV shows, but there are some that always catch my eye like RuPaul's Drag Race, Big Brother and The Circle. I would love to be a full time web developer, writing code for companies and making websites as a job would be super duper cool.
